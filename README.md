# SoundPhone

While learning how to use the  [_rest2mobile tool_](https://developer.magnet.com/rest2mobile), I decided to make an app for caching Soundcloud sets of my stream. With this in mind, I could now play with [**Podcast Apps**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict) the sets and they let me skip minutes if necessary!

## How To Use

You'll need to replace The **CLIENT_ID** and get an **OAUTH TOKEN** (where it is commented) to make the app work with your account. Decided to make it like this cause I was just trying first on making it work without an account manager. In the future I may add it.

## TODO

- Finish MP3 Tagging
- Add refresh, spinner & load next batch
- Include account selection from Soundcloud app or through Web Wrapper
- Anything you may see necessary for the app to get better
